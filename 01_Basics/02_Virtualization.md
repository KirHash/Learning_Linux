## Virtualization
Virtualization enables the hardware resources of a single computer to be divided into virtual computers, called virtual nachines

## Hypervisor
It is a software that creates and runs Virtual Machines

## Types of Hypervisor

### 1. Type 1 (Bare Metal)
These types of hypervisor are directly setup on the hardware. It works like a mini operating system and this hypervisor consists of the basic requirements that an Operating system requires

Example: VMware VSquare
Used By: Cloud Providers and Enterprise Servers

### 2. Type 2 (Hosted)
The hypervisor runs on the base or host operating system which is generally the primary operating system. They rely on the Host Machine's OS to manage operations such as CPU, network and storage management

Example: VMware Workstation, VirtualBox

## Advantages of VMs
1. No risk of any issues with the primary OS
2. Do not need external resources to use different OS
3. Testing of any application on different OS
4. It provides isolation from the rest of the environment of the system
